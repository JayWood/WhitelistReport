# Whitelist Report

* Bukkit Versions: 1.7, 1.8, 1.9, 1.10
* Author: [JayWood](http://plugish.com)
* Java Version: 1.8

## Description

Whitelist Report was built out of pure laziness. I was tired of having to type `/seen <playername>` to see when users were last online; and given the possible size of some white-listed servers, I'm sure you'll agree. SO, why not leverage the bukkit API and do that for me.

Simply put, with one command I can now display the dates users were last online.

## Commands

`/whitelistreport` - Displays the report

## Permissions

`wr.admin` - Allows the user to run the command.
